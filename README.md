Repository for my third homework: Py Me Up, Charlie, using Python programming.

**Challenge 1: PyBank**
I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company
from a csv file. It calculates the total profits/losses and the average
change, as well as displaying the months, greatest increase and decrease.
Some skills used for this activity were working with lists, writing and
reading external files, for loops and conditionals.
