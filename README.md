Repository for my third homework: Py Me Up, Charlie, using Python programming.

**Challenge 1: PyBank**

I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company
from a csv file. It calculates the total profits/losses and the average
change, as well as displaying the months, greatest increase and decrease.
Some skills used for this activity were working with lists, writing and
reading external files, for loops and conditionals.

**Challenge 2: PyPoll**

I created a Python script to create an efficient and modern voting system, 
as I was tasked with this in order to help a small, rural town modernize its 
vote counting process, by using several python functions. Skills such as lists,
conditionals, modules, and functions were used. The script adapts to any number of 
candidates as long as the three same columns are used.

**BONUS 1: PyBoss**
I created a Python script to modify employee information and records, due to a new 
HR program being implemented in a company, which requires certain data format 
for the program to work and store employee information. Skills such as functions, 
dictionaries, modules (such as datetime), and reading/writing csv files were used.
The resulting exported data is saved in the Analysis folder.
